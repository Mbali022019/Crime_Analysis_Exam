# South African Crime Analysis & Forecasting

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between socio-economic indicators and crime patterns in South Africa using two key datasets:

- **Dataset 1:** South African Crime Data  
  Source: [Kaggle – Crime Statistics for South Africa](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slwessels/crime-statistics-for-south-africa)  
  Description: Crime statistics by province, station, and year, used for hotspot classification and trend forecasting.

- **Dataset 2:** World Development Socio-Economic Indicators  
  Source: [Kaggle – World Development Indicators (The World Bank)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/world-development-indicators)  
  Description: Socio-economic metrics such as GDP, population, life expectancy, inflation, filtered for South Africa.

## Objectives
- Analyze how socio-economic factors correlate with crime rates.
- Identify and classify crime hotspots using machine learning (Random Forest).
- Forecast future crime trends with time series analysis (ARIMA).
- Provide actionable insights for policy and law enforcement.
- Develop an interactive Streamlit dashboard for data exploration and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Filtering:** Filter crime data by category, location, and year range.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Multiple visualizations showing crime trends and socio-economic correlations.
- **Classification Results:** Hotspot prediction with model accuracy and detailed classification report.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Crime trend forecasting with ARIMA including confidence intervals.
- **User-Friendly Summaries:** Both technical metrics and non-technical explanations.
